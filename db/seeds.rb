# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# ben = User.create(name: "Ben", username: "Ben1234", )
# User.create!(name: "Ben", username: "Ben1234")
# User.create!(name: "Sarah", username: "Sarah1234")
# User.create!(name: "Jill", username: "Jill1234")
# User.create!(name: "Henry", username: "Henry1234")
